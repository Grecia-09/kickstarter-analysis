# An analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends and generate insights for better understanding of campaigns

How can your fund-raising campaign be successful? Are there any specific factors that can help a campaign to be successful? 
To help you answer these questions and be able to plan ahead your crowdfunding I will provide you with a better understanding of different campaigns by looking into different factors that play an important role in making them.

I used data from different campaigns around the world, and I filtered the data to make it easier to highlight three important factors as: outcome of the campaign, goal vs. pledge amount, and the dates on which the campaign took placed.

The first thing I noticed was that the theater was the most successful category in US and other countries. We can easily see this information in the chart below:

**Figure 1. ** Stacked column chart of the outcome of the different categories of campaigns in US. The highest column shows us that theater is the most popular and has the most successful outcomes compares to the rest of categories.

Each category also has their own list of subcategories, it is really important to know which of the subcategory of theater has been more successful. I filtered again to obtain information about US and see that plays have the highest of successful outcomes. See Figure 2. for reference.

I wanted to provide you with the best time of the year to start a campaign, to do this I used the launched and deadline dates to calculate the length of fundraising campaigns tied with the outcome of the theater’s campaigns. See Figure 3. for reference.

I used measures of central tendency to determine how the fundraising goals amount can affect on the outcome of their campaigns. I noticed that the campaigns with much higher goal amount are the ones that failed the most. 
--
From this, it seems that if you want your fundraising campaign to be successful first you will need to launch it somewhere between May or June and will recommend to not last longer than 1 month. You should also consider not asking for a high goal amount, since asking for too much could probably set up for failure as the data has showed.
